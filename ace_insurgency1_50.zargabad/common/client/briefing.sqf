* BLUFOR objective is to find and destroy up to 9 ammo caches.<br/><br/>
* OPFOR objective is to stop them.<br/><br/>
* When OPFOR units are killed, some will drop silver briefcases. Every briefcase that is collected by BLUFOR reveals another map clue showing the rough distance to an ammo cache. Ammo caches can then be located and destroyed with a satchel or other explosives.<br/><br/>
* Red grid-squares may contain OPFOR units and need to be cleared by BLUFOR to become green grid-squares. For this to happen there must be no OPFOR units in the square and at least 1 BLUFOR infantry (up to 3, depending on mission settings) must enter it on foot.<br/><br/>

Mission by pogoman, revised and further developed by Fireball.<br/>
Insurgency is based on the gamemode created by Project Reality (an excellent realism mod for battlefield 2).<br/>
The patrolling AI vehicles use Kronzy's fantastic Urban Patrol Script (UPS).<br/>
The gear respawn dialog is a heavily modified version of the one used in Warfare - Benny edition.<br/>
Thanks to Swedge for the briefing contribution.<br/>
