Mission based originally on Insurgency by pogoman, revised and further developed by Fireball and Kol9yN.<br/>
Insurgency is based on the gamemode created by Project Reality (an excellent realism mod for battlefield 2).<br/>
The patrolling AI vehicles use Kronzy's fantastic Urban Patrol Script (UPS).<br/>
The gear respawn dialog is a heavily modified version of the one used in Warfare - Benny edition.<br/>
Thanks to Swedge for the briefing contribution.<br/>
<br/>
Added Artillery Support from bon, Transport from PITN, CargoDrop from sxp2high. <br/>

"Mission and Situation",
"
<br/>
* BLUFOR objective is to find and destroy up to 9 ammo caches.<br/><br/>
* OPFOR objective is to stop them.<br/><br/>
* When OPFOR units are killed, BLUEFOR can search their bodies. Sometimes the dead soldiers will have intelligence. Each piece of intelligence reveals another map clue showing the rough distance to an ammo cache. Ammo caches can then be located and destroyed with a satchel or other explosives.<br/><br/>
* Red grid-squares may contain OPFOR units and need to be cleared by BLUFOR to become green grid-squares. For this to happen there must be no OPFOR units in the square and at least 1 BLUFOR infantry (up to 3, depending on mission settings) must enter it on foot.<br/><br/>
* Artillery support is available. Transport by helicopter is available from Communication menu (requires Squad Leader). Cargo can be added and dropped to and from vehicles.<br/><br/>

"OPFOR Instructions",
"
<br/>
* 1 Human OPFOR player slot can be occupied for every 4 Human BLUFOR player slots occupied. If you try to play as OPFOR when there are not enough BLUFOR you will be automatically kicked and will need to re-connect to the server.<br/><br/>
* OPFOR units are only created when BLUFOR players approach red grid-squares.<br/><br/>
* Human OPFOR players can click an individual OPFOR unit on the map to take control of it, as long as BLUFOR players are not too close.<br/><br/>
* OPFOR units on the map have red markers unless they are engaging BLUFOR - when they become orange.<br/><br/>
* OPFOR are teleported away if they move too close to the BLUFOR HQ.<br/><br/>
* BLUFOR weapons can be taken from corpses. BLUFOR vehicles can be used but if you move them too far they disappear.<br/><br/>
* The Weapon caches contain a useful set of equipment, night vision goggles, some rifles, flares, ieds and a mortar!<br/><br/>
* Only about 25% of OPFOR have Night vision googles. Other soliders may have a Glock 17 pistol which has a small flash light.<br/><br/>
* You can use flares in the grenade launcher firing them into the air. Alternatively you use them to start a fire or build a camp fire to provide light.<br/><br/>

"Hints and Tips", 
"
<br/>
* Pressing K (or your defined key) will show you the compass, double pressing K will keep the compass on screen.<br/><br/>
* Pressing Right Ctrl and M (or your defined key) will show you a gps screen (if packed in your inventory) in the bottom right of the screen.<br/><br/>
* When you are injured but not killed, as long as your Bloodloss is less than 25% you may be able to crawl to safety using the movement keys, pressing the keys will cause the player to turn over onto their front and you can then crawl for a while.<br/><br/>
* To safely parachute from a helicopter, ideally you need to be at an altitude of 80 or greater.<br/><br/>
* Vehicles can be repaired/refuelled/rearmed at the HQ at the Service Point (next to the green hospital tent).<br/><br/>
* When 'Insurgency Markers' are set, you can click on the Green, Yellow and Blue triangles to show unit names and one more click will show player names. These markers also appear on the gps.<br/><br/>
* You can place a personal waypoint on the map, using Shift and clicking (useful when you are a pilot). Distance to the waypoint is then displayed in the game view.<br/><br/>
* You can place a marker on the map simply by double clicking on the map, you can adjust the color of the marker by using the left and right arrow keys, you can adjust the symbol of the marker by using the up and down arrow keys. A name can also be set. Use the delete key to remove markers from the map.<br/><br/>
* If a vehicle flips over whilst driving along, goto the Map view and using the radio set you can click on Unflip Vehicle. If the radio is small double click it to make it larger.<br/><br/>
* When a weapons cache is found, switch to the side channel team chat (Blue) and then mark on the map so all the squads can see the marker.<br/><br/>
* Injured team members can be pulled from the vehicle using the action menu on the vehicle 'Pull out Injured'.<br/><br/>
* If you are near a large explosion and you head gets thrown back and you can't correct it, goto the Map view and using the radio set you can click on Fix Headbug. This option also is useful if you are healed by someone but still can't walk afterwards.<br/><br/>
* To use weapons such as the mortar, one player must drop a Tripod bag, then a player carrying the M252 bag must aim at the tripod bag and choose the 'Assemble' option from the action menu.<br/><br/>
* Injured team members can be loaded into a vehicle, first use the action menu 'Drag' on the casualty, then use the option 'Carry', then move the cursor to the vehicle and use the option 'Load Injured into Vehicle'.<br/><br/>
* When using Satchel charges or IEDs you can set a timer on the charge using the action menu when looking at the item, each time you enter the action menu you can add 30 seconds to the timer.<br/><br/>
* If a BLUFOR vehicle wheel is damaged, get close and aim at the tyre to get a 'Change Tyre' option on the action mention.<br/><br/>
* Group leaders can grant requests  for helicopters, artillery, A10 and Apache support, using the communication command on the radio (0 and then 8).<br/><br/>
* When using artillery or motars, its good practice to mark on the map in the side channel the intended target areas and also let the team know that shots are inbound.<br/><br/>
* The vehicles (Humvee and Jackal) at the HQ can deploy ammo crates. Go to the rear of the vehicle to see this action menu option. Ammo crates should be re-loaded back into the vehicle using the action menu on the crate before driving off.<br/><br/>
* When using a spawned Chinook helicopter, if you land on the ground and get out, you will have 45 seconds before the AI pilot takes over (useful if you want to load a vehicle in to the helicopter). If you eject from the helicopter above an altitude of 2, the helicopter will fly off with no delay.<br/><br/>
* Hand signals for (Halt, Go, Take Cover, Advance and Point) are available, to use bind keys to the Custom keys dropdown for User15,User16,User16,User18,User19 and User20 commands in the Control options page.<br/><br/>
* Roadside IEDs are randomly found in Takistan, Vehicles and Infantry can set this off. If you are the Explosive Ordance Disposal role, it is possible to approach a roadside IED in the prone position and using SLOW crawl. A delayed detonation can be used when near the IED and then you have 120 seconds to fall back to safety.<br/><br/>
* Insurgency may light fires to see at night, you can put these out by getting close. They may also set fire to objects, if the object is destroyed the fire will go out, unless it's a vehicle.<br/><br/>

"Roadside IEDS / Pressure Plate IEDS", 
"
<br/>
IEDs have been randomly placed along the roadsides. These can be in the form of traditional IEDs (shells hidden in the ground/under rubbish) or as cars, wrecks, debris etc. Anything on the roadside should be treated with caution.<br/><br/>
If your squad has (Machine Gunner / Explosive Ordnance Disposal (slot 3) filled, this means that they can approach suspected roadside objects by crawling to them and inspecting them. If there is a roadside IED planted in the object, the EOD role will see an action item to carry out a delayed detontation. They then have 90 seconds to crawl away from the object to safety. Successfull removing roadside IEDS means the EOD role gets points and so does each member of the squad!<br/><br/>
OPFOR can place pressure plate IEDS, which react when a player or vehicle gets near them. These look like a pile of rubbish with a hidden shell/mine underneath. These can also be removed by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal role by crawling towards them and the squad get points!<br/><br/>

"Civilians", 
"
<br/>
On this map there are civilians. Don't kill them. Each civilian killed will count as a -5 score.<br/><br/>
If you are near a civilian you can get them to move out the way by focusing your crosshairs on them and using the action menu 'Get Away'. The civilians in the area will then run off in random directions, hopefully clearing the area.<br/><br/>
Civilians can also be told to 'Stop and Get Down' this is useful if you have a civilian running towards you.<br/><br/><br/>
Suicide Bombers<br/>
Some civilians are a threat, if you see a civilian acting strangely and coming towards you, it is recommended you ask them to 'Get Away' or 'Stop and Get Down'. If they continue to approach you they maybe a suicide bomber. Shooting a suicide bomber will award you with 10 points. But shooting a innocent civilian will award you with -5 points.<br/><br/></br>
Suicide Car Bombers<br/>
Some cars can be a threat too. Cars which approach you should be disabled by shooting out a tyre. If the driver gets out and approaches you ask them to 'Stop and Get Down' if they continue to approach they maybe a suicide bomber. Points are awarded to killing a suicide bomber and their vehicle.<br/><br/>

"Vehicles", 
"
<br/>
The BLUEFOR team have access to a number of road and air vehicles. These spawn at the HQ. If a vehicle is destroy it will respawn at the HQ.<br/><br/>
Helicopters<br/>
As well as the main transport helicopter at the HQ, the squad leader and pilot roles can request other forms of helicopters using the radio (0 and then 8).<br/>
When flying a helicopter, please do not land the helicopter at the Area of Operation (AO) / current objective. Always land some distance away.<br/>
The chinook can be loaded with cargo (Humvee/Ammo boxes/other objects). When the object to load is near your should see 'Load Cargo' option appear on the side of the helicopters action menu.<br/><br/></br>
Look after your vehicle<br/>
If you take a vehicle from the HQ, try not to leave it unattended. Make one member of the squad responsible for it. If you have to leave the vehicle, disable it by shooting out one of its tyres.<br/>
If the road vehicle damages a tyre, you can shoot it out and then change it for a new one using the action menu 'Change Tyre'<br/>
Vehicles can be serviced (repaired, rearmed and refueled) at the service point at the HQ (denoting with a yellow dotted square).<br/>
Most of the road vehicles have some gear stowed on them (grenades, M136, satchel charges). They may also have an ammo crate which can be unloaded onto the ground to rearm your squad, don't forget to load it back onto the vehicle when you are done.<br/>
Be careful when travelling on roads, as Roadside IEDS maybe present. More details can be found on these in the Roadside IED section of Notes.<br/><br/>

"Roles Explained", 
"
<br/>
Each squad is made up of five members:<br/>
<br/>
* Squad Leader - Responsible to the squads current mission, do what the squad leader says. Able to request helicopter/artillery and close air support.<br/><br/>
* Medic - As medic, you should always be close to the other members of your squad, you can heal the injured (shown with a green asterik when you are near them). Please don't equip with a sniper rifle if you are a medic, pick a close quarters weapon.<br/><br/>
* Machine Gunner / Explosive Ordnance Disposal - In this role, you should provide fire support for your squad, using a machine gun can supress the enemy whilst your team move position. This role can also detonate Roadside IEDS, to do so slowly approach the object on the roadside in a crawl position. If the object is an IED when you are near you will be given the option to carry out a delay detonation, you then have 90 seconds to crawl away to safety. Successful disposal of a roadside IED will give you 5 points and your squad members 3 points!<br/><br/>
* Marksman - Usually you will want to equip with a rifle with at least a scope, if not a sniper rifle. Providing cover/overwatch from a distance can be a great help to the squad. Remember if you fire from a position, you may want to then move as the enemy will start to move to your last fire position.<br/><br/>
* Pilot / Grenadier - As this role, you should try to stay close to your squad, provide close quarters support. As pilot you are able to request helicopter transport, which has approved by the squad leader. If you aren't a great pilot, go practice, but in the meantime you may want to swap role with someone else in the squad.<br/>

"Getting Started", 
"
<br/>
If you are new to Insurgency here are some quick pointers:<br/>
<br/>
* You can customize your weapon and other gear at the HQ. Approach the wheeled-apc (Stryker) and you will see an action menu 'Loadout'.<br/><br/>
* Once you have selected your weapon and other gear, click Save. This means if you die and respawn your kit will be the same as when you saved.<br/><br/>
* If you goto the Map view (Press M) you can zoom in with your scolling mouse wheel, clicking and holding the mouse button will move the map around.<br/><br/>
* The small green triangles are your squad members. Clicking on each of the triangles twice will show you their player names.<br/><br/>
* When you are getting started, we would advise that you join a squad with other members in it, and then follow them.<br/><br/>
* If you are injured, you can be healed. If you die, you can respawn at the HQ or near a team member as long as the enemy are not near by.<br/><br/>
